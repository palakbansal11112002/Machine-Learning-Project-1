# Machine-Learning-Project-1
Email Classification using different machine learning algorithms.

This project is of a similar nature. Udacity's course "Intro to Machine Learning" gives a step by step description of algorithms to used and their background.

We have a set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company. Our objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email.

The following algorithms will be used for the email classification:

1)Naive Bayes
2)SVM 
3)Decision Trees

SVM accuracy is 0.9510022271714922 
Naive Bayes acuuracy is 0.9820554649265906
Decision Tree is accuracy 0.68899788999
